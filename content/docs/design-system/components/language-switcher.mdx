## Overview

Renders a dropdown allowing users to switch locales. Selection is saved to the user profile and `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie.

## Import

```tsx
import { LanguageSwitcher } from "@/components/shared/language-switcher";
```

## Usage

```tsx
<LanguageSwitcher />
```

## Behavior

- Calls `updateUserLocale(locale)` server action
- Sets `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie and saves `preferredLocale` in DB
- Triggers `router.refresh()` to re-render with the new locale

## Notes

- Ensure locales (`i18n/config.ts`) exist in Tolgee project
- Middleware has `localeDetection: false` to avoid unwanted redirects
