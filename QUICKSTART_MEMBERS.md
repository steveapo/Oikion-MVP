## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Invite and Accept

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Browser 1: Sign in as ORG_OWNER
1. Go to /dashboard/members
2. Invite: test@example.com as AGENT
3. Note the invitation in pending list

# Browser 2 (incognito): Accept invitation
1. Sign up with test@example.com
2. Verify assigned to organization
3. Check role is AGENT

# Browser 1: Verify
1. Refresh /dashboard/members
2. See test@example.com in members list
3. Invitation moved to ACCEPTED
```

### Scenario 2: Role Hierarchy

```bash
# As ORG_OWNER:
‚úÖ Can invite any role
‚úÖ Can change anyone's role
‚úÖ Can remove anyone (except self)

# As ADMIN:
‚úÖ Can invite ADMIN, AGENT, VIEWER
‚ùå Cannot invite ORG_OWNER
‚úÖ Can change roles (except to ORG_OWNER)

# As AGENT:
‚ùå Cannot access /dashboard/members

# As VIEWER:
‚ùå Cannot access /dashboard/members
```

### Scenario 3: Protection Logic

```bash
# Try to change own role:
‚ùå Action menu hidden for self

# Try to remove last ORG_OWNER:
‚ùå Error: "Cannot remove the last organization owner"

# Try to remove self:
‚ùå Error: "You cannot remove yourself"
```

---

## üìä Verification

### Database Check

```bash
# Check invitation was created
npx prisma studio
# Navigate to: invitations table
# Verify: email, role, token, status, expiresAt

# Check member was assigned
# Navigate to: users table
# Verify: organizationId matches, role is correct
```

### Activity Log

```bash
# View activities
npx prisma studio
# Navigate to: activities table
# Look for: MEMBER_INVITED, MEMBER_ROLE_CHANGED actions
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Members link not showing in sidebar"

**Cause**: Your role is AGENT or VIEWER  
**Solution**: Sign in as ORG_OWNER or ADMIN

### "Insufficient permissions to invite users"

**Cause**: Your role is AGENT or VIEWER  
**Solution**: Ask an ADMIN or ORG_OWNER to upgrade your role

### "Invitation not auto-accepted"

**Cause**: Email doesn't match exactly (case-sensitive)  
**Solution**: Use exact email from invitation

### "TypeScript errors in IDE"

**Cause**: Prisma client cache not refreshed  
**Solution**: 
```bash
npx prisma generate
# Then restart TypeScript server in IDE
```

---

## üìß Email Integration (TODO)

Currently, invitations are sent but email notifications are not sent. To complete:

### 1. Configure Resend

```bash
# Add to .env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### 2. Implement Email Function

In `/lib/email.ts`, add:

```typescript
export async function sendInvitationEmail({
  to,
  inviterName,
  organizationName,
  role,
  token,
}: {
  to: string;
  inviterName: string;
  organizationName: string;
  role: UserRole;
  token: string;
}) {
  const acceptUrl = `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/register?email=${to}`;
  
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM!,
    to,
    subject: `You're invited to join ${organizationName}`,
    html: `
      <h2>You've been invited!</h2>
      <p>${inviterName} has invited you to join <strong>${organizationName}</strong> as a ${getRoleDisplayName(role)}.</p>
      <p><a href="${acceptUrl}">Sign Up Now</a></p>
      <p><small>This invitation expires in 7 days.</small></p>
    `,
  });
}
```

### 3. Uncomment in Actions

In `/actions/invitations.ts`:
- Line ~103: Uncomment `sendInvitationEmail()` call in `inviteUser()`
- Line ~260: Uncomment `sendInvitationEmail()` call in `resendInvite()`

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test basic invitation flow
2. ‚úÖ Test role changes
3. ‚úÖ Test member removal
4. ‚úÖ Test protection logic
5. ‚è≥ Implement email notifications
6. ‚è≥ Add E2E tests
7. ‚è≥ Deploy to staging
