# Dashboard Recent Properties Display Update

## Overview
Updated the recent properties list in the dashboard to display properties with a clearer "Name | Type | Status" format instead of "Type • Transaction Type" with a separate status badge.

---

## Changes Made

### Component Updated: [`recent-properties.tsx`](file:///Users/stapo/Desktop/Oikion%20App%20-%20Latest/components/dashboard/recent-properties.tsx)

#### **Before:**
```
Property Type • Transaction Type                [Status Badge]
📍 Location
€ Price  |  X bed  |  X bath
```

#### **After:**
```
Property Type in Location
Transaction Type • [Status Badge]
€ Price  |  X bed  |  X bath
```

## Display Format Details

### Row 1: Property Name
- **Format:** `{PropertyType} in {Location}`
- **Example:** "APARTMENT in Athens" or "HOUSE in Thessaloniki"
- **Style:** Font-medium, truncates if too long
- **Purpose:** Acts as the primary identifier/name for the property

### Row 2: Type | Status
- **Format:** `{TransactionType} • [Status Badge]`
- **Example:** "SALE • ACTIVE" or "RENT • DRAFT"
- **Style:** Small text with inline badge
- **Separator:** Bullet point (•) between type and status

### Row 3: Price & Details
- **Format:** `€ {Price} | {Beds} bed | {Baths} bath`
- **Example:** "€ 250,000 | 3 bed | 2 bath"
- **Style:** Compact, price in primary color
- **Note:** Beds/baths only show if available

## Technical Changes

### 1. Removed Import
```typescript
// Removed MapPin icon (no longer needed)
import { Home, Euro } from "lucide-react";
```

### 2. Reorganized Card Content
- Moved location into the property name/title
- Combined transaction type and status on same row
- Reduced vertical spacing (space-y-1 → space-y-1.5)
- Made status badge smaller and inline

### 3. Layout Improvements
- Property name is now more prominent as the primary identifier
- Transaction type (SALE/RENT/LEASE) is clearly visible
- Status badge is inline, taking less vertical space
- Better use of horizontal space

---

## Benefits

### ✅ **Clearer Identification**
- Properties now have a clear "name" (Type + Location)
- Easier to distinguish between properties at a glance

### ✅ **Better Information Hierarchy**
1. **Primary:** Property name/identifier
2. **Secondary:** Transaction type and status
3. **Tertiary:** Price and property details

### ✅ **More Compact**
- Status badge is inline instead of separate row
- Reduced vertical height per item
- Better use of available space

### ✅ **Consistent with Full Property List**
- Matches the format used in property cards: "{Type} in {Location}"
- Maintains consistency across the application

## Responsive Behavior

---

## Translation Support

All text elements support i18n:

- Transaction types (SALE, RENT, LEASE)
- Status labels (ACTIVE, DRAFT, ARCHIVED)
- UI labels (bed, bath) via translation keys
