# Personal Organization Protection - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  

---

## Overview

Every user in Oikion now has a permanent **Personal Organization** that cannot be deleted. This ensures users always have a workspace, even if they leave or are removed from team organizations.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Personal Org Creation
- **New Users**: Personal org created automatically during sign-up (via `auth.ts`)
- **Existing Users**: Migration script assigns personal orgs to users who don't have one
- **Naming**: Uses pattern `{name}'s Organization` or `{email}'s Organization`
- **Defaults**: 
  - `isPersonal: true`
  - `plan: FREE`
  - User becomes `ORG_OWNER`

### 2. Deletion Protection
- **Organization Deletion**: Personal orgs cannot be deleted through UI or API
- **User Account Deletion**: When a user deletes their account:
  - Personal org is **preserved** (not deleted)
  - Non-personal orgs with only that user are deleted
  - This allows data recovery if needed

### 3. Multi-Organization Support
- Users can belong to multiple organizations:
  - **1 Personal Org** (permanent, cannot delete)
  - **N Team Orgs** (can join via invitation, can be deleted by owners)
- Users can switch between orgs via the organization switcher

---

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
No schema changes required. Uses existing fields:
```prisma
model Organization {
  isPersonal Boolean @default(false)  // ‚úÖ Already exists
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/actions/organizations.ts`
```typescript
export async function deleteOrganization() {
  // ... authorization checks ...
  
  // Fetch organization and check if personal
  const organization = await prisma.organization.findUnique({
    where: { id: orgId },
    select: { isPersonal: true },
  });
  
  // Prevent deletion of personal organizations
  if (organization.isPersonal) {
    throw new Error("Cannot delete your personal organization.");
  }
  
  // ... delete logic ...
}
```

#### 2. `/app/api/organization/route.ts`
Same protection logic added to DELETE endpoint.

#### 3. `/components/dashboard/delete-organization.tsx`
```typescript
export function DeleteOrganizationSection({ 
  isPersonalOrg = false 
}: DeleteOrganizationSectionProps) {
  // Don't show delete option for personal orgs
  if (!allowed || isPersonalOrg) return null;
  // ... rest of component
}
```

#### 4. `/app/(protected)/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
```typescript
<DeleteOrganizationSection isPersonalOrg={organization?.isPersonal} />
```

#### 5. `/app/api/user/route.ts`
```typescript
// Only delete organization if it's NOT personal
if (memberCount === 1 && !dbUser.organization.isPersonal) {
  await prisma.organization.delete({ where: { id: dbUser.organizationId } });
}
```

#### 6. `/auth.ts`
Already creates personal orgs for new users (no changes needed):
```typescript
events: {
  async createUser({ user }) {
    // Create personal org
    const personalOrg = await prisma.organization.create({
      data: {
        name: `${user.name || user.email?.split('@')[0]}'s Organization`,
        isPersonal: true,
        plan: "FREE",
      }
    });
    // ... handle invitations or assign to personal org
  }
}
```

## Migration Scripts

### 1. `/scripts/ensure-personal-orgs.ts`
**Purpose**: Create personal orgs for existing users  
**Usage**: `npx tsx scripts/ensure-personal-orgs.ts`

**Logic**:
- Finds all users
- For each user without a personal org:
  - Creates a new personal organization
  - If user has no org, assigns them to it as ORG_OWNER
  - If user is in another org, just creates the personal org (available for switching)

**Output Example**:
```
üìä Found 2 total users
üÜï Creating personal org for testit@aaah.gr...
   ‚úì Assigned user to personal org as ORG_OWNER
‚ú® Migration complete!
   ‚Ä¢ Personal orgs created: 2
   ‚Ä¢ Users already had personal orgs: 0
```

### 2. `/scripts/verify-personal-org-protection.ts`
**Purpose**: Verify all users have personal orgs  
**Usage**: `npx tsx scripts/verify-personal-org-protection.ts`

**Checks**:
- Every user has an organization
- Organization exists and is accessible
- Counts personal vs team orgs
- Reports any users with issues

**Output Example**:
```
‚úÖ PASS: User testit@aaah.gr
   ‚Ä¢ Organization: testit's Organization
   ‚Ä¢ Is Personal: true
   ‚Ä¢ Role: ORG_OWNER

üìà Summary:
   ‚Ä¢ Users verified: 2/2
   ‚Ä¢ Users with issues: 0
   ‚Ä¢ Personal organizations: 2
   ‚Ä¢ Team organizations: 0

‚úÖ All checks passed!
```

## User Flows

### Flow 1: New User Sign-Up
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Signs Up] --> B[auth.ts createUser event]
    B --> C{Invitation exists?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Create Personal Org]
    C -->|No| D
    D --> E{Invitation exists?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Assign to Invited Org + Role]
    E -->|No| G[Assign to Personal Org as ORG_OWNER]
    F --> H[Personal Org available for switching]
    G --> I[User starts in Personal Org]
```

### Flow 2: User Tries to Delete Personal Org
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User clicks Delete Org] --> B{Is Personal Org?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Button hidden in UI]
    B -->|No| D[Show delete button]
    D --> E[User confirms deletion]
    E --> F[API checks isPersonal]
    F --> G{Is Personal?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Return error: Cannot delete]
    G -->|No| I[Delete organization]
```

### Flow 3: User Deletes Account
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User deletes account] --> B[API checks user's orgs]
    B --> C{User is ORG_OWNER?}
    C -->|Yes| D{Org has only 1 member?}
    C -->|No| E[Just delete user]
    D -->|Yes| F{Is Personal Org?}
    D -->|No| E
    F -->|Yes| G[Keep org, delete user]
    F -->|No| H[Delete org and user]
    E --> I[User account deleted]
    G --> I
    H --> I
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [x] Migration script runs successfully for existing users
- [x] Verification script confirms all users have personal orgs
- [x] New user sign-up creates personal org automatically
- [x] Personal org deletion is blocked via UI (button hidden)
- [x] Personal org deletion is blocked via API (returns error)
- [x] Non-personal org can still be deleted by ORG_OWNER
- [x] User account deletion preserves personal org
- [x] Organization switcher shows personal org

### Expected Behavior
1. **Settings Page**:
   - When viewing a personal org: "Delete Organization" section is hidden
   - When viewing a team org (as ORG_OWNER): "Delete Organization" section is visible

2. **API Responses**:
   - DELETE `/api/organization` for personal org: 400 error
   - DELETE `/api/organization` for team org: 200 success

3. **Account Deletion**:
   - User in personal org only: User deleted, personal org remains
   - User in team org (ORG_OWNER, solo): User deleted, team org deleted, personal org remains
   - User in multiple orgs: User deleted, all orgs remain

---

## Security & Data Integrity

### Protection Layers

1. **UI Layer**: Delete button hidden for personal orgs
2. **Server Action**: `deleteOrganization()` checks `isPersonal` flag
3. **API Route**: `/api/organization` DELETE checks `isPersonal` flag
4. **Account Deletion**: Preserves personal orgs automatically

### Database Constraints
- Personal orgs cannot be deleted while they have the `isPersonal: true` flag
- No additional DB constraints needed (application-level enforcement)

---

## Migration Guide for Production

### Step 1: Deploy Code
```bash
# Deploy updated application code
git pull origin main
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Step 2: Run Migration Script
```bash
# Ensure all users have personal orgs
npx tsx scripts/ensure-personal-orgs.ts
```

### Step 3: Verify
```bash
# Verify protection is working
npx tsx scripts/verify-personal-org-protection.ts
```

### Step 4: Monitor
- Check logs for any deletion attempts on personal orgs
- Verify users can still create and delete team orgs
- Monitor user feedback

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- [ ] **Personal Org Renaming**: Allow users to rename their personal org
- [ ] **Personal Org Transfer**: Transfer personal org to another user
- [ ] **Personal Org Archiving**: Hide personal org without deleting
- [ ] **Personal Org Restoration**: Restore archived personal orgs
- [ ] **Bulk Migration**: Migrate data between personal and team orgs

### Not Recommended
- ‚ùå **Allow Personal Org Deletion**: Defeats the purpose of permanent workspace
- ‚ùå **Multiple Personal Orgs**: One personal org per user is sufficient

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: User has no personal org
**Solution**: Run the migration script
```bash
npx tsx scripts/ensure-personal-orgs.ts
```

### Issue: Cannot delete team organization
**Check**: 
1. User is ORG_OWNER of the org
2. Organization is not marked as `isPersonal: true`
3. Check browser console for error messages

### Issue: Personal org was accidentally deleted
**Resolution**:
- Check database for orphaned data
- Recreate personal org manually:
```typescript
const personalOrg = await prisma.organization.create({
  data: {
    name: "User's Organization",
    isPersonal: true,
    plan: "FREE",
  }
});

await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: userId },
  data: { organizationId: personalOrg.id }
});
```
