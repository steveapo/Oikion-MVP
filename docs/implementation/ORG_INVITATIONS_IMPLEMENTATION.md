# Organization Invitation System Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: 🟢 Implementation Complete

---

## Overview

Completed the full implementation of the Organization Invitation and Member Management system, building on the RLS and database foundation completed earlier.

---

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### 1. Server Actions Created

#### `/actions/invitations.ts` ✅
- `inviteUser(email, role)` - Create and send invitation
- `acceptInvite(token, userId)` - Accept invitation during sign-up
- `cancelInvite(invitationId)` - Cancel pending invitation
- `resendInvite(invitationId)` - Resend invitation email
- `getInvitations()` - Fetch all org invitations

**Features:**
- ✅ Email validation
- ✅ Role validation
- ✅ Duplicate invite prevention
- ✅ Token generation (32-byte secure)
- ✅ 7-day expiration
- ✅ Activity logging
- ✅ TODO markers for email integration

#### `/actions/members.ts` ✅
- `getMembers()` - Fetch all organization members
- `updateMemberRole(userId, role)` - Change member role
- `removeMember(userId)` - Remove member from org
- `getMemberCount()` - Get member count

**Features:**
- ✅ RBAC enforcement via `canManageMembers()`
- ✅ Role assignment validation via `canAssignRole()`
- ✅ Self-modification prevention
- ✅ Last owner protection
- ✅ Activity logging

### 2. Auth Integration

#### `/auth.ts` ✅ UPDATED
**createUser Event Enhanced:**
- Checks for pending invitation by email
- If invitation exists:
  - Assigns user to invitation's organization
  - Sets role from invitation
  - Marks invitation as ACCEPTED
  - Logs activity
- If no invitation:
  - Creates new organization (existing behavior)
  - Sets user as ORG_OWNER

**Flow:**
1. User signs up with email
2. System checks for pending invitation
3. Auto-assigns to org if invited
4. Falls back to creating new org

### 3. UI Components

#### Page: `/app/(protected)/dashboard/members/page.tsx` ✅
- Server component with role-based access
- Fetches members and invitations
- Conditional rendering for managers
- Integrated all sub-components

#### Form: `/components/members/invite-member-form.tsx` ✅
- Email + role selection
- Zod validation
- Role descriptions in dropdown
- Toast notifications
- Loading states

#### List: `/components/members/members-list.tsx` ✅
- Table display of all members
- User avatars
- Role badges with color coding
- "You" indicator for current user
- Action menu (role change, remove)
- Self-protection (no self-edit)

#### Pending: `/components/members/pending-invitations.tsx` ✅
- Pending invitations table
- Expiration countdown
- Visual warnings for expiring invites
- Resend invitation action
- Cancel invitation action

#### Dialogs:
- `/components/members/update-member-role-dialog.tsx` ✅
  - Role selection dropdown
  - Only shows assignable roles
  - Confirmation + loading
  
- `/components/members/remove-member-dialog.tsx` ✅
  - Destructive confirmation
  - Warning alert
  - Loading state

### 4. Navigation

#### `/config/dashboard.ts` ✅ UPDATED
Added Members link to sidebar:
- Icon: users
- Route: `/dashboard/members`
- Authorization: `UserRole.ADMIN` (ORG_OWNER and ADMIN can access)

## 📝 TODO: Email Integration

Email sending is prepared but not implemented. Add to `/lib/email.ts`:

```typescript
export async function sendInvitationEmail({
  to,
  inviterName,
  organizationName,
  role,
  token,
}: {
  to: string;
  inviterName: string;
  organizationName: string;
  role: UserRole;
  token: string;
}) {
  const acceptUrl = `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/accept-invite?token=${token}`;
  
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,
    to,
    subject: `You're invited to join ${organizationName} on Oikion`,
    html: `
      <p>Hi,</p>
      <p>${inviterName} has invited you to join <strong>${organizationName}</strong> as a ${getRoleDisplayName(role)}.</p>
      <p><a href="${acceptUrl}">Accept Invitation</a></p>
      <p>This invitation will expire in 7 days.</p>
    `,
  });
}
```

**Locations to uncomment:**
- `/actions/invitations.ts` lines ~103, ~260
- Add `sendInvitationEmail` import

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

### Design Patterns Used
- **Card-based layout** - Consistent with existing dashboard
- **Table for lists** - shadcn/ui Table component
- **Dialogs for actions** - Non-destructive modal pattern
- **Dropdown menus** - Actions per row
- **Toast notifications** - Sonner for feedback
- **Loading states** - Spinner icons during async operations
- **Badge variants** - Visual role hierarchy
- **Empty states** - Helpful messaging when no data

### Accessibility
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ ARIA labels
- ✅ Screen reader text
- ✅ Focus management
- ✅ Form error states

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Works With
- ✅ **RLS System** - All queries org-scoped via `prismaForOrg()`
- ✅ **RBAC** - Uses `lib/roles.ts` helpers
- ✅ **Auth.js** - Invitation auto-acceptance on sign-up
- ✅ **Activity Feed** - Logs member actions
- ✅ **Dashboard Nav** - Integrated into sidebar

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Email notifications (Resend integration)
- [ ] Bulk invite (CSV upload)
- [ ] Custom invitation messages
- [ ] Team roles (beyond user roles)
- [ ] Member activity analytics
- [ ] Invitation templates
- [ ] SSO integration

---

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

- All server actions use `auth()` session check
- Member list loads all members (paginate if >100)
- Invitations list shows all (filter by status if needed)
- Page uses React Server Components (no client-side data fetching overhead)

---

## 🔍 Error Handling

### User-Facing Errors ✅
- "User must belong to an organization"
- "Insufficient permissions to invite users"
- "User is already a member"
- "Invitation already sent"
- "Invitation not found / expired"
- "Cannot remove yourself"
- "Cannot remove last owner"

### Logging ✅
- All errors logged to console with context
- Activity table records member actions
- Failed operations return `{ success: false, error: "..." }`

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria - All Met ✅

- ✅ Database schema includes Invitation model
- ✅ Server actions for invitations implemented
- ✅ Server actions for members implemented
- ✅ Auth integration handles invite tokens
- ✅ Members page created and functional
- ✅ UI components created (forms, lists, dialogs)
