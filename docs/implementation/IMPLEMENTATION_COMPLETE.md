**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Project**: Oikion - Real Estate Agency Operating System  
**Scope**: Multi-tenancy Security + Invitation System

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1: Database & RLS Foundation ✅

#### Migrations
1. **`20251015_rls_policies`** - RLS policy creation for all tenant tables
2. **`20251015_user_cascade_delete`** - Cascade deletion rules
3. **`20251016_invitations_and_rls_cleanup`** - Invitation system + policy cleanup

#### Database Schema
- ✅ `Invitation` model with token-based workflow
- ✅ `InvitationStatus` enum (PENDING, ACCEPTED, CANCELED, EXPIRED)
- ✅ Updated Organization and User relationships
- ✅ 40 RLS policies across 10 tables (4 per table)
- ✅ All policies cleaned (removed duplicates)

#### Security Infrastructure
- ✅ RLS enabled on all tenant-scoped tables
- ✅ Org-scoped Prisma client (`prismaForOrg()`)
- ✅ Session variable approach (`app.current_organization`)
- ✅ Application-level isolation (PRIMARY enforcement)

## 🔐 Security Model

### Multi-Layer Defense Architecture

#### Layer 1: Application Isolation (PRIMARY ✅)
- **Status**: Active and enforced
- **Mechanism**: `prismaForOrg(organizationId)`
- **Coverage**: All server actions
- **Enforcement**: Session variable per transaction

#### Layer 2: RLS Policies (DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH ⚠️)
- **Status**: Configured (not enforced due to Neon BYPASSRLS)
- **Policies**: 40 policies active
- **Value**: Documentation + future-proofing
- **Migration Path**: Ready for self-hosted PostgreSQL

#### Layer 3: RBAC (ACTIVE ✅)
- **Roles**: ORG_OWNER, ADMIN, AGENT, VIEWER
- **Helpers**: `/lib/roles.ts`
- **Enforcement**: All sensitive actions

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Checklist
```bash
# 1. Start the dev server
pnpm dev

# 2. Test Invitation Flow
- Navigate to /dashboard/members (as ADMIN+)
- Invite a user with email
- Check invitation appears in pending list
- Sign up with invited email
- Verify auto-assignment to org

# 3. Test Member Management
- View members list
- Change a member's role
- Remove a member
- Try to remove yourself (should fail)
- Try to remove last owner (should fail)

# 4. Test Permissions
- Log in as different roles
- Verify VIEWER cannot access /dashboard/members
- Verify AGENT cannot invite users
- Verify ADMIN can manage members
```

### Verification Scripts
```bash
# Check database state
npx tsx scripts/check-db-state.ts

# Verify invitations table
npx tsx scripts/verify-invitations.ts

# Complete setup verification
npx tsx scripts/verify-complete-setup.ts
```
