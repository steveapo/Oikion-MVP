# Testing & Quality Assurance Standards

## Testing Philosophy

### Current Approach
- Manual testing primary method
- No automated test suite currently
- Comprehensive manual checklists
- Staging environment for validation
- User acceptance testing

### Future Considerations
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
- When team grows or complexity increases
- ROI of automated testing

## Manual Testing Checklist
