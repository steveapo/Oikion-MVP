# Invitation Link Fix - Complete

## Problem
The invitation link wasn't working because:
1. **Missing token in URL**: Email link only had `?email=...` but no `?token=...`
2. **No acceptance flow**: Existing users had no way to accept invitations
3. **New users only**: System only worked during registration, not for existing users

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Invitation Email (`lib/email.ts`)
**Before**:
```typescript
const acceptUrl = `/register?email=${email}`;
```

**After**:
```typescript
const acceptUrl = `/accept-invite?token=${token}`;
```

Now includes the invitation token in the URL.

### 2. Created Accept Invitation Page (`app/(auth)/accept-invite/page.tsx`)
New dedicated page that handles invitation acceptance for both:
- **Existing users**: Automatically accepts and adds them to the organization
- **New users**: Redirects to registration with token preserved

**Features**:
- ✅ Validates token exists and is valid
- ✅ Checks if invitation is expired
- ✅ Checks if already accepted
- ✅ Validates email matches (for signed-in users)
- ✅ Creates `OrganizationMember` entry
- ✅ Switches user to invited organization
- ✅ Marks invitation as ACCEPTED
- ✅ Logs activity
- ✅ Shows clear error messages for all edge cases

### 3. Flow Diagram

#### For Existing Users:
```
1. User clicks invitation link
   ↓
2. Goes to /accept-invite?token=xxx
   ↓
3. System checks: User is signed in?
   ↓
4. Email matches invitation? 
   ↓
5. Creates membership in OrganizationMember
   ↓
6. Switches active organization
   ↓
7. Redirects to /dashboard?invitation=accepted
```

#### For New Users:
```
1. User clicks invitation link
   ↓
2. Goes to /accept-invite?token=xxx
   ↓
3. System checks: User NOT signed in
   ↓
4. Redirects to /register?email=xxx&token=xxx
   ↓
5. User registers
   ↓
6. auth.ts createUser event finds pending invitation
   ↓
7. Creates memberships (personal + invited org)
   ↓
8. User lands in invited organization
```

### 4. Error Handling

The accept-invite page handles:
- ❌ No token provided
- ❌ Invalid token
- ❌ Expired invitation
- ❌ Already accepted invitation
- ❌ Email mismatch (wrong user signed in)
- ❌ Database errors during acceptance

Each error shows a clear message and action button.

### 5. Testing Steps

#### Test 1: New User Invitation
```bash
1. Send invitation to newuser@test.com
2. Check email for invitation link
3. Click link (should go to /accept-invite?token=xxx)
4. Should redirect to /register?email=xxx&token=xxx
5. Register with newuser@test.com
6. Should land in invited organization
7. Dropdown should show: Private Workspace + Invited Org
```

#### Test 2: Existing User Invitation  
```bash
1. Sign in as existing user (e.g., demo@gmail.com)
2. Send invitation to demo@gmail.com from different org
3. Click invitation link
4. Should go to /accept-invite?token=xxx
5. Should auto-accept and redirect to /dashboard
6. Dropdown should now include new organization
7. Active org should be the newly invited one
```

#### Test 3: Email Mismatch
```bash
1. Send invitation to userA@test.com
2. Sign in as userB@test.com
3. Click invitation link for userA
4. Should show error: "Email Mismatch"
5. Options: Sign Out or Go to Dashboard
```

#### Test 4: Expired Invitation
```bash
1. Create invitation (manually set expiresAt to past)
2. Click invitation link
3. Should show: "Invitation Expired"
4. Clear message to contact org owner
```

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/email.ts`** (line 76)
   - Changed invitation URL from `/register?email=...` to `/accept-invite?token=...`

2. **`app/(auth)/accept-invite/page.tsx`** (NEW)
   - Created dedicated invitation acceptance page
   - Handles all validation and edge cases
   - Works for both existing and new users

3. **`auth.ts`** (line 88-96)
   - Added comment clarifying invitation flow
   - No functional changes needed (already works for new users)

## Database Flow

When invitation is accepted:

```sql
-- 1. Create membership
INSERT INTO organization_members (userId, organizationId, role)
VALUES (user_id, invited_org_id, invited_role);

-- 2. Update user's active organization
UPDATE users 
SET organizationId = invited_org_id, role = invited_role
WHERE id = user_id;

-- 3. Mark invitation as accepted
UPDATE invitations 
SET status = 'ACCEPTED'
WHERE id = invitation_id;

-- 4. Log activity
INSERT INTO activities (actionType, entityType, entityId, ...)
VALUES ('MEMBER_INVITED', 'USER', user_id, ...);
```

## Benefits

1. **Token-based security**: Uses secure random token, not just email
2. **Works for everyone**: Both new and existing users
3. **Clear UX**: Proper error messages and redirects
4. **Audit trail**: Activity logging for compliance
5. **Membership retention**: Users keep access to all organizations
6. **Email validation**: Ensures right user accepts invitation
