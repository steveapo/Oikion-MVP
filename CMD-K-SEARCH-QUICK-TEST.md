## What Changed (Simple Version)

### Before
- ❌ Searched properties by city/region (not description)
- ❌ Searched clients by email/phone (not just name)
- ❌ Properties might be excluded if no listing exists

### After
- ✅ Searches properties by **description** (property name/title)
- ✅ Searches clients by **name only**
- ✅ All properties show up (no listing filter)

---

## If Nothing Shows Up

### Check Your Data
```sql
-- Check if properties have descriptions
SELECT id, description, "propertyType" FROM properties LIMIT 5;

-- Check if clients have names
SELECT id, name FROM clients LIMIT 5;
```

### Expected Results
- Properties: Must have `description` field with text
- Clients: Must have `name` field with text

### If Data is Empty
1. Create a test property with description
2. Create a test client with name
3. Try searching again

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No properties show | Add text to property `description` field |
| No clients show | Ensure client has a `name` |
| Can't click results | Check browser console for errors |
| Arrow keys don't work | This is handled by cmdk library automatically - if broken, check for JS errors |
