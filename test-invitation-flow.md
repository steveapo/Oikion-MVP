# Agency Invitation System - Fixed

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Invitation Validation (`actions/invitations.ts`)
- **Before**: Checked if user exists with `organizationId` matching the org
- **After**: Checks `OrganizationMember` table to see if user is already a member

### 2. Updated Accept Invitation (`actions/invitations.ts`)
- **Before**: Only updated user's `organizationId` and `role`
- **After**: 
  - Creates entry in `OrganizationMember` table
  - Updates user's active organization
  - User now has membership in both personal workspace AND invited organization

### 3. Updated Auth Flow (`auth.ts`)
- **Before**: Invited users lost access to personal workspace
- **After**:
  - New users always get personal workspace membership
  - If invited, also get membership to invited organization
  - Invited organization becomes the active one
  - Personal workspace remains accessible via dropdown

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: New User Registration (No Invitation)
1. User registers at `/register`
2. Personal workspace ("Private Workspace") is created
3. User becomes ORG_OWNER of personal workspace via `OrganizationMember`
4. Personal workspace is set as active organization
5. Result: User has 1 organization membership

### Scenario 2: New User with Invitation
1. Admin/Owner sends invitation via Members page
2. New user clicks invitation link â†’ `/register?email=invited@user.com`
3. User signs up with that email
4. System creates:
   - Personal workspace with membership (ORG_OWNER)
   - Membership to invited organization (with invited role)
5. Invited organization is set as active
6. Result: User has 2 organization memberships (can switch between them)

### Scenario 3: Existing User Invited to New Organization
1. Admin/Owner sends invitation to existing user's email
2. Existing user signs in
3. Auth checks for pending invitations on sign-in
4. Creates membership to new organization
5. Switches user to new organization as active
6. Result: User now has access to all their previous orgs PLUS the new one

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Invite New User
```bash
1. Sign in as admin@oikion.com
2. Go to /dashboard/members
3. Click "Invite Member"
4. Enter: newuser@test.com, Role: AGENT
5. Check email (development mode sends to your verified email)
6. Click invitation link
7. Register with newuser@test.com
8. Verify:
   - User lands in "Oikion" organization
   - Dropdown shows: "Private Workspace" AND "Oikion"
   - Can switch between both
```

### Test 2: Invite Existing User
```bash
1. Create second test org with admin@oikion.com
2. Create new organization "Test Agency"
3. Switch back to "Oikion"
4. Invite demo@gmail.com (existing user)
5. Sign in as demo@gmail.com
6. Verify:
   - Still in current org
   - New invitation shows up in pending invitations
   - After accepting, dropdown shows all 3 orgs
```

## Database Schema

```prisma
model OrganizationMember {
  id             String       @id @default(cuid())
  userId         String
  organizationId String
  role           UserRole
  joinedAt       DateTime     @default(now())
  
  user           User         @relation(...)
  organization   Organization @relation(...)
  
  @@unique([userId, organizationId])
}
```

## Key Functions Updated

1. **`inviteUser()`** - Checks membership table before sending invitation
2. **`acceptInvite()`** - Creates membership when accepting
3. **`auth.ts createUser`** - Creates memberships for personal + invited orgs
4. **`getUserOrganizations()`** - Returns all orgs user is a member of
5. **`switchOrganization()`** - Validates membership before switching

## Migration Applied

```bash
# Created organization_members table
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate

# Populated existing users' memberships
node scripts/populate-memberships.mjs
```

## Notes

- Personal workspace is ALWAYS created for new users
- Users can be members of multiple organizations
- Only one organization is "active" at a time (`user.organizationId`)
- Dropdown shows all organizations user is a member of
- Personal workspace is always shown first in the list
